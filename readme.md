### The structure of your project.
- grab an element and the the url for fetching the data.
- Create a fetch function using *async await*.
- I also added the sort function inside the fetch.
- After that, I created the html.
- And finally, I call the fetch function.
### I learn many things dong this project such us:
- fetching data from server whithout you create the object.
